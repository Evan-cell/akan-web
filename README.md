#project description
Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such as Togo,
Ivory Coast and Ghana. A child’s name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth.
For example, the day of their birth or the manner in which they were born may determine which
name they get irrespective of their gender. These Akan names signify the day one is born.
According to Akan tradition, each child is born with a name associated to their soul.
The day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul. The well thought and organized
naming system of the Akan’s was initiated by the ancestors and has attracted so many people’s
attention as they desire to know more about these names. As a matter of fact, it is possible
to tell what led to someone’s birth, the day they were born and their rank among the siblings
just by their names. This is why you need to read this article to know more about Akan names
and their meanings. Read more: https://yen.com.gh/115080-akan-names-meanings.html
The website will help to calculate the day of birth based on the Akan names.
